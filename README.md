## Ontology

Below are some resource for common BioMedical related Ontology resources

[GO Ontology](http://geneontology.org/)

[OBO Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/)


[OntoBee](https://ontobee.org/)

Ontobee is aimed to facilitate ontology data sharing, visualization, query, integration, and analysis. Ontobee dynamically dereferences and presents individual ontology term URIs to (i) HTML web pages for user-friendly web browsing and navigation, and to (ii) RDF source code for Semantic Web applications. Ontobee is the default linked data server for most OBO Foundry library ontologies. Ontobee has also been used for many non-OBO ontologies.
